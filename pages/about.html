        <p>Hi myself Kavyasri, I'm Currently pursuing a master's degree in computer science.<br>
            I have developed a Website [Kavyasri], combining HTML and CSS to ensure structured and visually appealing content presentation,<br> 
            leveraging semantic HTML elements for accessibility and SEO.<br>
             Utilizing responsive design principles, I ensured optimal viewing across devices,<br>
             While navigation menus, styled with CSS, ensured consistent user interaction.<br>
             Typography enhancements, along with CSS box model utilization, maintained readability and visual consistency.<br>
             The website [kavyasri] showcases my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and responsive design, reflecting dedication to excellence in crafting exceptional digital experiences.<br>
